\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

In this section, analyze how sensitive the model outputs are to key parameters and assumptions. Typical approaches include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Local sensitivity analysis with respect to one parameter at a time;
  \item Global sensitivity analysis for multiple parameters;
  \item Scenario analysis and robustness checks.
\end{itemize}

You can add figures and tables here to illustrate the results.
